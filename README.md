# WebAssembly SpecTec

This repository is a clone of the `wasm-3.0` branch of [github.com/WebAssembly/spec/](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/).
It contains the prototype implementation of [SpecTec](spectec/README.md) and a version of the core spec document modified to be built with SpecTec.

Original `README` from upstream repository follows...


# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly specification,
a reference implementation, and the official test suite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).

# citing
